            <h5>Four Panel FIBC Bags</h5>
            <p>
              Four Panel FIBC (Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container) Bags are a
              type of bulk bag used for transporting and storing dry and
              granular materials, such as powders, grains, and minerals. As the
              name suggests, these bags are designed with four panels, creating
              a rectangular shape when the bag is filled.
              <br />
              <br />
              The design of 4 Panel FIBC Bags ensures that they are more stable
              and less prone to bulging or collapsing during transport or
              storage. The four-panel construction provides additional support
              to the bag and helps to distribute the weight of the contents
              evenly.
              <br />
              <br />
              4 Panel FIBC Bags are typically made from woven polypropylene
              fabric, which provides strength and durability to handle the
              weight of the contents. These bags come with lifting loops for
              easy handling and transportation using forklifts or cranes.
              <br />
              <br />
              These bags can be customized with various features, such as
              liners, coatings, and discharge options, to suit different
              application requirements. They are widely used in the agriculture,
              construction, and chemical industries for the transportation and
              storage of a wide range of materials.
