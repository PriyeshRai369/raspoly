              Roofing Underlayment serves as a critical barrier, protecting
              against water, wind, and severe weather while enhancing your
              roof's integrity. It is typically installed on the roof deck.

              Synthetic Underlayment, also known as non-bitumen synthetic
              underlayment, provides superior protection compared to traditional
              shingles. It is lightweight, easy to install, and designed to
              prevent skidding, enhancing walkability during installation. This
              tough material resists moisture, UV damage, tears, leaks, and
              fungal growth, and remains wrinkle-free even in harsh conditions.
              Available in longer, wider rolls, it reduces the number of trips
              up the ladder
