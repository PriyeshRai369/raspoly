              Geotextile is manufactured with an aim to improve and maintain
              soil stability mainly for agriculture and conservation purpose.
              This geotextile fabric is different from weed cloth. The purpose
              of weed cloth is to stop the unwanted growth of weeds, whereas geo
              textile fabric is the best solution for the stabilization of soil
              on any construction site. It also helps to stop erosion due to
              stormwater. Moreover, it offers very good results for separation,
              filtration, reinforcement, and drainage.

            <p>
              Geotextile woven fabric is one of the best environmentally
              friendly products. It has very good features like waterproofing,
              low water flow rate, high tensile strength, etc. It is used in
              many applications like building construction, civil engineering
              project, airport runways, water conservancy, petrochemical,
              landfill drainage, railway embankment, retention pool, salt
              industry, agriculture, etc. Due to its excellent physical
              properties and mechanical strength, its lifespan is more than a
              hundred years.

              <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>Geotextile fabric uses:</span>{" "}
              It is a type of synthetic fabric that is often used in
              construction and engineering projects. It is usually made from
              polypropylene or polyester and is used to improve the stability
              and drainage of the soil. Geotextile woven fabric is often used to
              reinforce retaining walls, stabilize roadways, and improve
              drainage in agricultural and landscaping applications. It can also
              be used to filter sediment from water or to protect fragile
              ecosystems from the effects of construction or other human
              activity.
