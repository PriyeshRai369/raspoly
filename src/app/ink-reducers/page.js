              Our woven sack inks are primarily low-viscosity and alcohol-based,
              designed for both treated and untreated woven sack fabrication.
              These inks can be printed using flexographic printing technology
              and are formulated with various resistant properties, including
              urea resistance, alkali resistance, and rub resistance. Woven
              sacks are primarily used for outer packaging of products.

              Our highly efficient inks can be used on both polyester and BOPP
              films, featuring high print density, excellent print finish, and
              adhesion properties. They find versatile applications on various
              substrates, including pan, oil and vanaspati, soap wrappers, and
              more.
            </p>
            <h4>Substrates:</h4>
            <p>
              These inks can be printed on all types of polyethylene, requiring
              a treatment level of 38 dynes/cm for optimal adhesion and
              resistance properties.
            </p>
            <h4>Ink Preparation:</h4>
            <p>
              Mix 5% of catalyst (Hardener A) and 5% of catalyst (Hardener B)
              with AR ink at the time of printing, stirring well. A lower
              proportion of catalyst may lead to inferior resistance properties
            </p>
            <h4>Press Returns:</h4>
            <p>
              Press returns should be mixed with fresh inks in a ratio of 1:4,
              ensuring that the amount of catalyst corresponds to the quantity
              of fresh ink.
            </p>
            <h4>Diluents:</h4>
            <p>
              Our inks tolerate a wide range of solvents to accommodate
              variations in press speed and conditions. Recommended diluents
              include toluene or a blend of isopropyl alcohol, with butyl
              alcohol suggested as a retarder.
            </p>

              <p>
                After a minimum of 48 hours of curing, prints should be immersed
                in a 2% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution for 24 hours.
                Following this, the prints should be rinsed under tap water and
                gently rubbed with cotton soaked in water; the prints must not
                come off. Our two-pack ultra-gloss AR inks are ideal for
                detergent, washing powder, oil/ghee, spice packaging, and all
                food packaging containing oils and spices. Inferior resistance
                properties may result from:
              </p>
              <strong>
                A treatment level lower than the recommended 38 dynes/cm
              </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Improper catalyst ratio or mixing</strong>
