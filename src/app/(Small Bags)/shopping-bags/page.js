              A <strong>shopping bag</strong> is a large bag designed to carry
              items purchased in stores or markets, providing convenience and
              ease of transport for shoppers. These bags typically feature
              handles, which can be either short or long, allowing for

            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Paper</strong>: Often made from recycled materials,
                paper bags are biodegradable and come in various strengths and
                styles. They may have a kraft paper finish for a rustic look or
                be coated for additional durability and moisture resistance
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Plastic</strong>: These bags are lightweight and
                water-resistant, making them a popular choice for grocery
                shopping. They can be either single-use (thin, grocery-style
                bags) or reusable (thicker, sturdier bags). Reusable plastic
                bags often have reinforced handles for added strength.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cloth</strong>: Made from materials like cotton, canvas,
                or non-woven polypropylene, cloth bags are durable and reusable.
                They come in various designs and colors, and many people prefer
                them for their sustainability, as they reduce the need for
                single-use plastic bags.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <ol>

                <strong>Handles</strong>: The handles can be made from the same
                material as the bag or from different materials like rope or
                fabric for added comfort and strength. Some bags may have padded
                handles for extra comfort during extended use.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Size and Capacity</strong>: Shopping bags come in

                <strong>Closure Options</strong>: Some bags feature closures
                like zippers or Velcro, while others remain open for easy access
                to items.
