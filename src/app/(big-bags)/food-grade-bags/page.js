              <strong>Food-grade bags</strong> are specifically designed to store and transport food items safely. They are made from materials that are safe for direct contact with food and do not contain harmful chemicals or toxins that could leach into the food. These bags meet strict health and safety standards set by regulatory bodies, ensuring that they are manufactured under hygienic conditions to avoid contamination.
