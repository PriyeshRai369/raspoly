                    <h1>What Are FIBC Bags ?</h1>
                    <p>
                      A flexible intermediate bulk container (FIBC), jumbo, bulk
                      bag, super sack, big bag, or tonne bag is an industrial
                      container made of flexible fabric that is designed for
                      storing and transporting. It has multiple industrial
                      applications
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      FIBCs are most often made of thick woven strands of
                      oriented polypropylene,[4] either coated or uncoated. FIBC
                      bags are used around the world as an economical
                      alternative to traditional shipping and storage solutions,
                      such as wood pallets, plastic containers or metal bins.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      FIBC bags are used because of their practicality,
                      durability, reusability and other beneficial qualities
                      that make them ideal shipping, containing and storage
                      solutions. Depending on what they’re used for, FIBC bags
                      can be made of different materials or designed in
                      different shapes and sizes. FIBC bags are designed to
                      withstand enormous tensile strength, with some types being
                      rated to carry up to 5,000 pounds per bag.

                  <h2>What Are FIBC Bags Made Of ?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Manufacturers can use a variety of materials to produce bulk
                    bags. However, the most common material used to produce FIBC
                    bags is polypropylene — a petroleum-based product.
                    Polypropylene is a soft, woven, flexible and lightweight
                    thermoplastic that’s entirely recyclable.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Polypropylene is an inert material, meaning it won’t undergo
                    erosion and degradation due to chemical processes. This
                    property is what gives FIBC bags the durability and
                    reusability that make them so desirable in shipping and
                    storage solutions. The tight weave of polypropylene fibers
                    makes FIBC bags and capable of holding weights exponentially
                    heavier than the material itself. These properties and more
                    are what make FIBC bags beneficial and increasingly popular
                    in the supply chain.

                        Cross-corner or Circular FIBC bags are a type of
                        Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container (FIBC) that have
                        their lifting loops or straps sewn diagonally across the
                        corners of the bag. This design ensures that the loops
                        are aligned with the corners of the bag and not the
                        sides, providing a more secure and stable lift.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The cross-corner design allows for easy handling and
                        transportation of bulk materials, particularly when
                        using forklifts or cranes. The diagonal placement of the
                        lifting loops also helps to evenly distribute the weight
                        of the bag, reducing the risk of tearing or damage
                        during transportation.

                        <br />
                        Cross-corner FIBC bags are available in various sizes,
                        shapes, and materials to suit different application
                        requirements. They can be customized with liners,
                        coatings, and other features to provide additional
                        protection and functionality. They are widely used for
                        the transportation and storage of a variety of bulk
                        materials, including agricultural products, construction
                        materials, chemicals, and minerals.

                      <p>
                        U panel FIBC bags are a type of Flexible Intermediate
                        Bulk Container (FIBC) that are designed with a U-shaped
                        panel on either side of the bag. The U-panel design
                        creates a more cubic shape when the bag is filled,
                        allowing for better space utilization during
                        transportation and storage.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        U-panel FIBC bags are typically made from woven
                        polypropylene fabric, which provides strength and
                        durability to handle the weight of the contents. These
                        bags can be customized with various features, such as
                        liners, coatings, and discharge options, to suit
                        different application requirements.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        U-panel FIBC bags are commonly used for the
                        transportation and storage of dry and granular
                        materials, such as grains, seeds, powders, and
                        aggregates. The U-panel design ensures that the bag
                        maintains its shape during transport, reducing the risk
                        of bulging or collapsing. This, in turn, helps to
                        minimize the use of space during transportation and
                        storage, leading to cost savings.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Overall, U-panel FIBC bags are a cost-effective and
                        versatile option for bulk material transportation and
                        storage, especially for those looking to optimize space
                        utilization.

                        more stable and less prone to bulging or collapsing
                        during transport or storage. The four-panel construction
                        provides additional support to the bag and helps to

                        fabricated into a circular woven polypropylene material.
                        Woven polypropylene baffles are pre-cut with oval
                        dye-cut holes that are sewn into the material diagonally
                        across each corner. Baffle FIBCs (bulk bags) can have
                        eight reinforcement sections that are woven into the
                        polypropylene loom to attach four rigid cross-corner
                        loops that allow the forklift operator to pick up bags

                      <p>
                        Tunnel Lift Builders Bags have been specially designed
                        for use with fork lift trucks. The two continuous
                        tunnels run along the sides of the bag allowing for easy
                        loading onto truck forks.
