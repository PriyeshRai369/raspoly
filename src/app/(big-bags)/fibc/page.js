                    <h1>What Are FIBC Bags ?</h1>
                    <p>
                      A flexible intermediate bulk container (FIBC), jumbo, bulk
                      bag, super sack, big bag, or tonne bag is an industrial
                      container made of flexible fabric that is designed for
                      storing and transporting. It has multiple industrial
                      applications
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      FIBCs are most often made of thick woven strands of
                      oriented polypropylene,[4] either coated or uncoated. FIBC
                      bags are used around the world as an economical
                      alternative to traditional shipping and storage solutions,
                      such as wood pallets, plastic containers or metal bins.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      FIBC bags are used because of their practicality,
                      durability, reusability and other beneficial qualities
                      that make them ideal shipping, containing and storage
                      solutions. Depending on what they’re used for, FIBC bags
                      can be made of different materials or designed in
                      different shapes and sizes. FIBC bags are designed to
                      withstand enormous tensile strength, with some types being
                      rated to carry up to 5,000 pounds per bag.

                  <h2>What Are FIBC Bags Made Of ?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Manufacturers can use a variety of materials to produce bulk
                    bags. However, the most common material used to produce FIBC
                    bags is polypropylene — a petroleum-based product.
                    Polypropylene is a soft, woven, flexible and lightweight
                    thermoplastic that’s entirely recyclable.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Polypropylene is an inert material, meaning it won’t undergo
                    erosion and degradation due to chemical processes. This
                    property is what gives FIBC bags the durability and
                    reusability that make them so desirable in shipping and
                    storage solutions. The tight weave of polypropylene fibers
                    makes FIBC bags and capable of holding weights exponentially
                    heavier than the material itself. These properties and more
                    are what make FIBC bags beneficial and increasingly popular
                    in the supply chain.
