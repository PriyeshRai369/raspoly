              Our polypropylene multifilament yarns, available in high and
              medium tenacity, come in three types: intermingled, twisted, and
              cabled, with a denier range from 300 to 5000.
            </p>
            <h5>Uses & Functions</h5>
            <p>
              PP yarns serve as the ideal starting material for weaving,
              braiding, twisting, and sewing.
            </p>
            <h5>Features & Benefits</h5>
            <p>
              Our PP yarns are available in various colors, including natural,
              black, and blue, with additional colors upon request. They boast
              excellent technical properties, including high tenacity, chemical
              resistance, and flexibility. Precision winding is offered for
              coarse yarns, while high-quality twisting ensures smooth
              performance during sewing.
            </p>
            <h5>Applications</h5>
            <p>
              Common applications include sewing, slings, industrial use,
              braided ropes, webbing, nets, belts, and filtration.
            </p>
            <h5>Seam Variants</h5>
            <p>
              Available seam options include single chain, Heracles (overlock),
              double chain stitch, and Heracles (overlock) + chain stitch
              (safety stitch). The specific seam type is determined during
              production based on the capacity of the big bag.

              <img className="aimsImg" src="assets/images/product/aim.jpeg" />
              Air Intermingled Yarns are produced through a process where air
              pressure creates nips at regular intervals, causing the flat yarn
              filaments to become entangled. This results in the yarns being
              intermingled along their length with evenly spaced nips. These
              yarns are ideal for use in high-speed fabric conversion machines,
              including those for narrow and wide fabrics, belts, and cords. The
              yarns are precision-wound with a stepped approach, ensuring smooth
              operation in high-speed processes such as stitching, weaving, and
              braiding.

              />
              Twisted yarns are produced by twisting flat yarns according to
              specific application requirements. These yarns are commonly used
              in fabrics, webbings, sack stitching, FIBCs (Flexible Intermediate
              Bulk Containers), flexible luggage, tarpaulins, and other similar
              products.

            <h4>FLAT YARN</h4>
            <p>
              <img className="aimsImg" src="assets/images/product/flat.jpeg" />
              Flat yarns are simple, fully drawn yarns without any additional
              processing. They are commonly used in applications such as weft
              yarns in narrow webbings, various types of ropes, specialized
              woven fabrics, and webbings.
