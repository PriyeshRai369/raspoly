              A <strong>conical bag</strong> is a specialized bulk bag designed
              for the efficient discharge of materials that tend to be sticky or
              difficult to release, such as brown sugar, premixed flour, or
              other powdery substances. The conical shape at the bottom of the
              bag helps in preventing material buildup and ensures smooth,
              quick, and complete discharge of the contents. This design
              minimizes product residue inside the bag, making it ideal for
              industries handling materials prone to clumping or sticking
              together
