              Our journey began in 1983 with a dream, and with every rising sun,
              we moved forward, giving wings to that dream and watching it soar.
              Starting with the trading of jute bags and later establishing a
              small manufacturing setup under a modest shed, we steadily
              progressed. In 1987, we inaugurated a larger facility in Varanasi
              for mass production of jute bags, marking a significant step in
              our growth.

            By 1999, we installed our first tapeline of 100 kg/hour along with 10 looms dedicated to the production of HDPE/PP bags.

            <p>In 2002, we diversified into the paper production industry by setting up a new plant in Varanasi. Building on this, in 2006, we expanded our operations by acquiring a paper plant in Pune, further strengthening our foothold in the paper industry.</p>
            <p>In 2011, we took a bold step into the global market with the export of FIBCs.</p>
            <p>From then with every new day, we continue to add value in all the segments we operate, setting new milestones along the way.</p>
