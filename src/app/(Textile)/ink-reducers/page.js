            <p>
              Can be printed on all types of polyethylene. For polyethylene the
              treatment should be 38 dynes per / cm for good adhesion and
              optimum resistance properties
            </p>
            <h4>Ink Preparation:</h4>
            <p>
              5 % of catalyst (Hardner A) and 5 % of catalyst (Hardner B) to be
              mixed with AR Ink at the time of printing and stirred well Lower
              proportion of catalyst will lead to inferior resistance property
            </p>
            <h4>Press Returns:</h4>
            <p>
              Press returns are mixed with the fresh inks in the ratio of 1:4.
              Amount of catalyst should correspond to the quantity of fresh ink
            </p>
            <h4>Diluents:</h4>
            <p>
              The inks have a tolerance with a wide range of solvents to
              accommodate variation in press speed and conditions. Recommended
              diluents are Toluene or blend of Isopropyl Alcohol. Butyl Alcohol
              is recommended as Retarded
