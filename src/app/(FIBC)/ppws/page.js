                  PP woven bags are PP plastic bags produced by the weaving
                  process. To create a fabric for the needs of the plastic
                  industry, several threads or tapes are weaved in two
                  directions (warp and weft). This process is known as weaving.
                  One type of thermoplastic resin material created by the
                  polymerization of propylene is polypropylene (PP).

                      Food contact packaging - These bags are also increasingly
                      being used to package foods such as maize, rice, flour,
                      and others.

                      Geotechnical engineering - Woven PP fabrics are excellent
                      for use in buildings, ports, mines, railroads, irrigation
                      projects, roads, and other structures. Because of their
                      capacity to filter, drain, isolate, and prevent seepage,
                      they are favored geosynthetics.

                      PP woven bags, which are used as flood control items, are
                      essential in minimizing the negative impacts of floods.
                      For the building of river banks, dams, and other projects
                      of this nature, woven polypropylene sandbags are
                      frequently required.

                      Special applications - Woven PP bags can also be
                      customized for a variety of very specialized uses.
                      Examples include UV-resistant versions that last longer
                      even when exposed to sunshine all the time.

                  Polypropylene is a 100% recyclable material that is both
                  reusable and recyclable. As a result, it has no impact on the
                  generation of waste. The makers of woven bags and other
                  sellers reuse these bags after several uses to create other
                  consumable goods.

                  Dunnage bags are very easy to work with. They inflate rapidly
                  with the use of an inflator using compressed air. Dunnage bags
                  are very safe to use for both the shipping and receiving end
                  of the transportation. They are waterproof. The cushions are
                  easy to install and are inflated by compressed air often by
                  means of an outlet in the truckâ€™s compressed air system or
                  compressors.
