              Cross-corner or Circular FIBC bags are a type of Flexible
              Intermediate Bulk Container (FIBC) that have their lifting loops
              or straps sewn diagonally across the corners of the bag. This
              design ensures that the loops are aligned with the corners of the
              bag and not the sides, providing a more secure and stable lift.
              <br />
              <br />
              The cross-corner design allows for easy handling and
              transportation of bulk materials, particularly when using
              forklifts or cranes. The diagonal placement of the lifting loops
              also helps to evenly distribute the weight of the bag, reducing
              the risk of tearing or damage during transportation.
              <br />
              <br />
              Cross-corner FIBC bags are available in various sizes, shapes, and
              materials to suit different application requirements. They can be
              customized with liners, coatings, and other features to provide
              additional protection and functionality. They are widely used for
              the transportation and storage of a variety of bulk materials,
              including agricultural products, construction materials,
              chemicals, and minerals.
