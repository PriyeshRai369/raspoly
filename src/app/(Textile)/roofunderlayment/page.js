              The primary role of roofing underlayment is to act as a barrier
              material providing resistance against water, wind, or any other
              severe weather conditions and providing extra protection to your
              roof. It is generally installed on the roof deck..

              Synthetic underlayment, also called non-bitumen synthetic
              underlayment. Synthetic roofing underlayment gives the roof an
              additional surface of safety that is not possible solely with
              shingles. It is lightweight and thin compared to asphalt felts.
              Moreover, the installation process is also very easy. It is a
              tough, durable, and high strength, designed in such a way that it
              prevents skidding and improves walkability during installation due
              to its unique textured fabric. It is resistant to moisture, UV
              damage, tears, leaks, and fungal growth and is wrinkle-free even
              when exposed to the elements. It is available in longer and wider
              rolls; hence it gets fewer trips up the ladder due to fewer rolls.
