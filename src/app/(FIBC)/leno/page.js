            <p>
              Leno is a kind of weaving technique. The manufacturers twist
              adjacent wrap tapes around consecutive weft tapes that offer these
              bags a unique spinal pair in this technique. These unique spinal
              pair effectively locks each weft in place.
              <br />
              <br />
              Made from polypropylene, the leno bags are highly flexible. At the
              same time, these bags are tough, moisture resistant, and sustain
              heavy weight. Moreover, one can easily transport the bags without
              much discomfort. The Polypropylene Leno bags are primarily used to
              store and transport agricultural materials, making the materials
              durable without causing any harm. The bags have superior
              ventilation, making it easy for people to see the materials
              present through the bags. The sewing present at the bottom of
              these bags contains single or double folds and double stitching,
              including the top hemming and drawstring.
